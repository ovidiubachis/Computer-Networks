Technical Specifications & Logic
Routing Protocols: Implemented dynamic routing using OSPF/RIP for efficient packet delivery.

VLAN Management: Segmented the network into multiple VLANs (HR, IT, Management) to enhance security and reduce broadcast traffic.

Subnetting: Designed an efficient IPv4 addressing scheme using VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) to minimize IP waste.

Security: Configured Standard and Extended ACLs (Access Control Lists) to restrict unauthorized access between departments.

Services: Integrated DHCP for automatic IP assignment and DNS for hostname resolution.
